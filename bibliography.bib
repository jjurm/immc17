abstract = {In healthy male top athletes several functions were measured after either a westbound flight over six time-zones (WEST: Frankfurt–Atlanta; n=13) or an eastbound flight over eight time-zones (EAST: Munich–Osaka; n=6). Under either condition the athletes performed two standardized exercise training units in the morning and in the afternoon within 24 h, investigations were done as controls in Germany and on day 1, 4, 6, and 11, after arrival. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of time-zone transitions on the 24h profiles of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) using an ambulatory BP device (SpaceLabs 90207), for up to 11 d after arrival at the destination. As additional parameters, we studied jet-lag symptoms, training performance, and training coordination by using visual analog scales. Finally, oral temperature and grip strength were measured, and saliva samples were analyzed for cortisol and melatonin. The study showed that all functions were disturbed on the first day after arriva...},

abstract = {Traveling across time zones causes disruption to the normal circadian rhythms and social schedules because of travelers' shift in time. As the endogenous circadian timing system adapts slowly to new time cues, the phase relationship be-tween biological rhythms and external time cues are out of synchronization for a period of time. This disturbance of circa-dian rhythms has been shown to impair physical and psycho-logical health (Winget et al., 1984). To test the effects of re-peated jet lag on mental abilities, airline cabin crew were compared with ground crew. Salivary cortisol was used as a physiological marker for circadian disruption. The cabin crew group, who had a history of repeated jet lag, had significantly higher salivary cortisol levels in an average working day. In addition, this elevated level of cortisol was only seen in the same subjects when the cabin crew were on transmeridian flights but not domestic flights. Cabin crew also exhibited cognitive deficits, possibly in working memory, that became apparent after several years of chronic disruption of circadian rhythms.},

@article{Chung2004,
abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that administration of the air with 30{\%} oxygen compared with normal air (21{\%} oxygen) enhances cognitive functioning through increased activation in the brain. A visuospatial task was presented while brain images were scanned by a 3 T fMRI system. The results showed that there was an improvement in performance and also increased activation in several brain areas in the higher oxygen condition. These results suggest that a higher concentration of breathed oxygen increases saturation of blood oxygen in the brain and facilitates performance.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effect of 30{\%} oxygen inhalation on visuospatial cognitive performance, blood oxygen saturation, and heart rate. Six male (25.8(mean)±1.0(SD) years) and six female (23.8±1.9 years) college students participated in this experiment. Two psychological tests were developed to measure the performance level of visuospatial cognition. The experiment consisted of two runs: one was a visuospatial cognition task under normal air (21{\%} oxygen) condition and the other under hyperoxic air (30{\%} oxygen) condition. The experimental sequence in each run consisted of four phases, that were Rest1 (1min), Control (1min), Task (4min), and Rest2 (4min). Blood oxygen saturation and heart rate were measured throughout the course of four phases. The analysis of behavioral performance with 30{\%} oxygen administration when compared to 21{\%} oxygen revealed that the mean performance was improved. When supplied 30{\%} oxygen in the air, the blood oxygen saturation was increased while the heart rate was decreased compared to those under 21{\%} oxygen condition. We conclude that 30{\%} oxygen inhalation enhanced visuospatial performance by the increased the oxygen saturation in the blood.},

@article{Scholey1999,
abstract = {It was recently established that supplemental oxygen administration significantly enhances memory formation in healthy young adults. In the present study, a double-blind, placebo-controled design was employed to assess the cognitive and physiological effects of subjects' inspiration of oxygen or air (control) prior to undergoing simple memory and reaction-time tasks. Arterial blood oxygen saturation and heart rate were monitored during each of six phases of the experiment, corresponding to baseline, gas inhalation, word presentation, reaction time, distractor and word recall, respectively. The results confirm that oxygen administration significantly enhances cognitive performance above that seen in the air inhalation condition. Subjects who received oxygen recalled more words and had faster reaction times. Moreover, compared to participants who inhaled air, they exhibited significant hyperoxia during gas administration, word presentation, and the reaction-time task, but not at other phases of the experiment. Compared to baseline, heart rate was significantly elevated during the word presentation, reaction-time, and distractor tasks in both the air and oxygen groups. In the oxygen group, significant correlations were found between changes in oxygen saturation and cognitive performance. In the air group, greater changes in heart rate were associated with more improved cognitive performance. These results are discussed in the context of cognitive demand and metabolic supply. It is suggested that under periods of cognitive demand a number of physiological responses are brought into play that serve to increase the delivery of metabolic substrates to active neural tissue. These mechanisms can be supplemented by increased availability of circulating blood oxygen, resulting in an augmentation of cognitive performance. Heart rate reactivity and the capacity for increased blood oxygen appear to be important physiological individual differences mediating these phenomena.},
