abstract = {Does temperature affect economic performance? Has temperature always affected social welfare through its impact on physical and cognitive function? While many economic studies have explored the indirect links between climate and welfare (e.g. agriculture, conflict, sea-level rise), few address the possibility of direct impacts operating through physiology, despite a deep medical literature documenting the temperature sensitivity of human task performance. This paper attempts a synthesis of these literatures by (1) presenting a microeconomic model of labor supply under thermal stress, and (2) using country-level panel data on temperature and income (1950-2005) to illustrate the potential magnitude of temperature-driven productivity impacts. Using a fixed effects estimation strategy, we find significant temperature sensitivity of per capita income that varies, crucially, with a country's position relative to an optimal temperature zone. Hotter-than-average years are associated with lower output per capita for countries in hot climates and higher output per capita for countries in cold ones: approximately 3{\%}-4{\%} per degree C in both directions. Air-conditioning mediates the adverse impact of hotter years, consistent with the physiological explanation. This more direct causal link between climate and social welfare has important implications for both the economics of climate change and comparative development.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED Several industries experience periods of cold exposure and rewarming throughout the workday but mental performance under these conditions is unknown. A better understanding of cognition during the rewarming phase after cold exposure may help reduce accidents and improve performance. Ten young men (wearing {\~{}}0.1 clo) underwent three consecutive mornings trials where they were exposed to cold air (10°C) and then subsequently rewarmed (25°C air). A computerised test battery was administered during each stage of the protocol to determine working memory, choice reaction time, executive function and maze navigation. Rectal and skin temperature, oxygen consumption and thermal sensation were also measured throughout and showed a typical response. Relative to baseline performance, working memory, choice reaction time and executive function declined during exposure to 10°C, and these impairments persisted 60 min into the recovery period (i.e. once physiological parameters had returned to baseline). Further work is needed to develop countermeasures to this predicament. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY This study showed that working memory, choice reaction time and executive function declined during exposure to 10°C air, and these impairments persisted 60 min into the rewarming period (i.e. once measurable physiological parameters had returned to normal). Individuals may be at risk for injury after removal from a cold environment.},

abstract = {Cognitive function defines performance in objective tasks that require conscious mental effort. Extreme environments, namely heat, hypoxia, and cold can all alter human cognitive function due to a variety of psychological and/or biological processes. The aims of this Focused Review were to discuss; (1) the current state of knowledge on the effects of heat, hypoxic and cold stress on cognitive function, (2) the potential mechanisms underpinning these alterations, and (3) plausible interventions that may maintain cognitive function upon exposure to each of these environmental stressors. The available evidence suggests that the effects of heat, hypoxia, and cold stress on cognitive function are both task and severity dependent. Complex tasks are particularly vulnerable to extreme heat stress, whereas both simple and complex task performance appear to be vulnerable at even at moderate altitudes. Cold stress also appears to negatively impact both simple and complex task performance, however, the research in this area is sparse in comparison to heat and hypoxia. In summary, this focused review provides updated knowledge regarding the effects of extreme environmental stressors on cognitive function and their biological underpinnings. Tyrosine supplementation may help individuals maintain cognitive function in very hot, hypoxic, and/or cold conditions. However, more research is needed to clarify these and other postulated interventions.},

abstract = {Traveling across time zones causes disruption to the normal circadian rhythms and social schedules because of travelers' shift in time. As the endogenous circadian timing system adapts slowly to new time cues, the phase relationship be-tween biological rhythms and external time cues are out of synchronization for a period of time. This disturbance of circa-dian rhythms has been shown to impair physical and psycho-logical health (Winget et al., 1984). To test the effects of re-peated jet lag on mental abilities, airline cabin crew were compared with ground crew. Salivary cortisol was used as a physiological marker for circadian disruption. The cabin crew group, who had a history of repeated jet lag, had significantly higher salivary cortisol levels in an average working day. In addition, this elevated level of cortisol was only seen in the same subjects when the cabin crew were on transmeridian flights but not domestic flights. Cabin crew also exhibited cognitive deficits, possibly in working memory, that became apparent after several years of chronic disruption of circadian rhythms.},

Six male (25.8(mean)±1.0(SD) years) and six female (23.8±1.9 years) college students participated in this experiment. Two psychological tests were developed to measure the performance level of visuospatial cognition. The experiment consisted of two runs: one was a visuospatial cognition task under normal air (21{\%} oxygen) condition and the other under hyperoxic air (30{\%} oxygen) condition. The experimental sequence in each run consisted of four phases, that were Rest1 (1min), Control (1min), Task (4min), and Rest2 (4min). Blood oxygen saturation and heart rate were measured throughout the course of four phases. The analysis of behavioral performance with 30{\%} oxygen administration when compared to 21{\%} oxygen revealed that the mean performance was improved. When supplied 30{\%} oxygen in the air, the blood oxygen saturation was increased while the heart rate was decreased compared to those under 21{\%} oxygen condition. We conclude that 30{\%} oxygen inhalation enhanced visuospatial performance by the increased the oxygen saturation in the blood.},

abstract = {It was recently established that supplemental oxygen administration significantly enhances memory formation in healthy young adults. In the present study, a double-blind, placebo-controled design was employed to assess the cognitive and physiological effects of subjects' inspiration of oxygen or air (control) prior to undergoing simple memory and reaction-time tasks. Arterial blood oxygen saturation and heart rate were monitored during each of six phases of the experiment, corresponding to baseline, gas inhalation, word presentation, reaction time, distractor and word recall, respectively. The results confirm that oxygen administration significantly enhances cognitive performance above that seen in the air inhalation condition. Subjects who received oxygen recalled more words and had faster reaction times. Moreover, compared to participants who inhaled air, they exhibited significant hyperoxia during gas administration, word presentation, and the reaction-time task, but not at other phases of the experiment. Compared to baseline, heart rate was significantly elevated during the word presentation, reaction-time, and distractor tasks in both the air and oxygen groups. In the oxygen group, significant correlations were found between changes in oxygen saturation and cognitive performance. In the air group, greater changes in heart rate were associated with more improved cognitive performance. These results are discussed in the context of cognitive demand and metabolic supply. It is suggested that under periods of cognitive demand a number of physiological responses are brought into play that serve to increase the delivery of metabolic substrates to active neural tissue. These mechanisms can be supplemented by increased availability of circulating blood oxygen, resulting in an augmentation of cognitive performance. Heart rate reactivity and the capacity for increased blood oxygen appear to be important physiological individual differences mediating these phenomena.},
