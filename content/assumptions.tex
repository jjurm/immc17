\begin{assumption}
The individual importance of all attendants is the same.
\end{assumption}

We treat all attendants in the same way. Theoretically, some of them could be more important that the other in a way that they are irreplaceable experts in their field. But according to the given problem task, each attendant contributes approximately equally to the end result of their intellectual teamwork.

\begin{assumption}
Attendants arrive no sooner than the day before the first day of the conference and have at most one night to rest and start acclimatizing.
\end{assumption}

According to the task, the meeting is substantially important and for the simplicity of the problem, we assume that in a real situation no one would be willing to start the meeting not having rested and acclimatized to the environment for at least one night. On the other side, the budget of the organizing company is limited and hence attendants are not able to arrive in advance to rest more.

\begin{assumption}
Every place that is suitable for the meeting must be of a certain size in order to comprise a certain level of base infrastructure necessary for the meeting.
\end{assumption}

See section \ref{subsec:discrete} for more details.
