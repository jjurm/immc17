So far, the only criteria we considered are related to productivity. This method of finding the perfect spot for holding the meeting is great from a mathematical perspective, but in real life, there are other criteria that may influence the decision besides maximum productivity. The most significant non-productivity based criterion is the overall cost.

Determining the overall cost of such an event is rather problematic, because there are many variables that can differ from place to place, such as accomodation, food, travel etc. If we were able to gather this much information about all the different expenses on all 7000 cities that we compared from the productivity standpoint, we would do it that way.
