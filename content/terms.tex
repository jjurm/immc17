\term{Attendant} Someone who attends the meeting

\term{Productivity $P$} The ratio of the amount of work carried out under certain conditions and the amount of work one would meet in ideal conditions. Productivity is expressed in percentage terms and therefore implies exponential growth in all aspects. It follows that in these terms of percentages we use geometric relations, e.g. geometric mean instead of arithmetic average.

\term{Day index $D$} Index of the particular day of the meeting. $D = 0$ is the day of the arrival (in the timezone of the destination) and $D = 1, 2, 3$ are the first, second and third days of the conference, respectively.
