The purpose of the previous section was to evaluate the effect of the proposed factors on attendants, yet if we were to forget about the constrains of the problem for a while then we could find alternative solutions which would  minimize some of the factors. 

When it comes to jet lag there are efficient ways to quickly recover and make the effects almost undetectable. An app called Sleep as Android gets people gradually used to the shifted sleeping patterns days before travel by a revolutionary method called \emph{intermittent light therapy} \cite{JiriRichter2016}. The method and why it works is described in more detail in this article about a modern way to solve the jet lag problem \cite{TracieWhite2016}. There, we can learn about how jet lag treatment is getting to new dimensions where people will not be affected anymore. Furthermore, the influence of the light pollution factor can be lowered by using sleep masks. Theoretically, people could also wear oxygen masks to eliminate the significance of the altitude aspect.

Finding alternative solutions is not the goal of this work, however we believe that for the purpose of the meeting, attendants should be aware of them.
