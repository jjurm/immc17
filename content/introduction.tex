You and your colleagues are working on perhaps the most salient project you have ever been involved with. The clock is ticking fast and your entire team has to make immensely critical decisions. This is when winners are separated from losers and legends are born. There are a plethora of reasons why things might go wrong and the goal of our paper is to ensure that the whereabouts of your meeting are not one of them. 

Organizing events can bring headaches even to experienced coordinators. Given a set of attendants with diverse preferences, ages, and origins, they have to find a place where everyone will do their best. Our paper designs a model which returns an ordered list of locations based on a set of attendants considering a sundry range of factors. The factors are sub-models to the main algorithm. It also cuts the price of the meeting as much as possible while leaving the extent to which productivity will be compromised to the organizers.

The final part of this paper is dedicated to showcasing the architecture and implementation of our algorithm in Java and the integration of a user-friendly UI.
