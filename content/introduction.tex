You and your colleagues are working on perhaps the most salient project you have ever been involved with. The clock is ticking fast and your entire team has to bring immensely critical decisions. This is when winners are separated from losers and legends from mortals. There is a plethora of reasons why things might go wrong and the goal of our paper is to ensure that the whereabouts of your meeting are not one of them. 

Organizing events can bring headaches even to experienced coordinators. Given a set of attendants with diverse preferences, ages and origins, they have to find a place where everyone will be at their best. Our paper designs a model which returns an ordered list of locations based on a set of attendants considering a sundry range of factors. The factors are sub-models to the main algorithm. Then we will try to cut the price of the meeting as much as possible while leaving the extent to which productivity will be compromised to the organizers.

In the final part of this paper we will look at the architecture and implementation of our algorithm in Java and we will integrate a user friendly UI.
